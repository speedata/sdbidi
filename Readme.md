# Unicode bidi algorithm for Go

This is a copy of [Go's unicode bidi algorithm](https://github.com/golang/text/tree/master/unicode/bidi) with a package API.
There is [a submission](https://golang.org/cl/267857) for integrating this API into the main x/text package.
Until this patch is accepted or if this rejected this API will be used for
the [speedata Publisher](https://github.com/speedata/publisher)
